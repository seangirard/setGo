Update: I will probablynever touch this again. 

It was fun while it lasted!

#############################################

A simple plugin pattern for your jQuery application.

Put your app logic in __init().
Add your own options and methods.
Success/failure callbacks are provided.

All public methods provided can be changed or removed.
All private objects/functions (prefixed w/ __) should be kept.

To change your application namespace: 
- Change value of var __namespace
- Change public method names

NOTE: 
- setGo is meant to contain your app logic.
- You might consider it the "last link" in your chain.
- This may not turn out to be a very good design and may behave unexpectedly.
- In retrospect, preventEvent is probably not a very good idea. Leaving it in for now though.

ToDo:
- Documentation
- Finish README

Known Issues:
- Unecessary recursion in the object constructor ($obj)?
- Method calls are wrapped in try/catch; you can unwrap them
